# Context Engineering Talk - Breadcrumb Summary

## Purpose & Function

**This breadcrumb file is the master source of truth and context alignment layer between human (Dasith) and AI agent.** It provides everything needed to restart conversations and continue work from the current state. For detailed development history and decision rationale, see [`conversation_summary.md`](./conversation_summary.md).

  - **20-minute**: Conference presentation (core framework + Breadcrumb demo)
  - **40-minute**: Technical meetup (adds Manus production lessons + deeper technical analysis)
- **Core Thesis**: Context engineering, not prompt engineering, is the key to effective AI-assisted development
- **Target Audience**: Developers working with AI coding assistants

### **Core Frameworks**
#### **Problem Framework: Constraint-Context Matrix**
- **Two Dimensions**: Open vs. closed solution spaces × Implied vs. provided context
- **AI Sweet Spot**: Closed solutions + Provided context
- **Failure Modes**: Poisoning, Distraction, Confusion, Clash

#### **Solution Framework: Four Context Tactics**
1. **Write Context**: External memory (scratchpad pattern, context offloading)
2. **Select Context**: Smart retrieval (RAG + tool loadout, 30+ tools create confusion)
3. **Compress Context**: Efficient summaries (pruning + summarization)
4. **Isolate Context**: Separation of concerns (context quarantine)

### **Talk Formats Available**
- **20-minute**: Conference presentation (core framework + Breadcrumb demo)
- **40-minute**: Technical meetup (includes Manus production lessons)

### **Files Structure**
```
context_engineering/
├── Narrative.md - Main abstract and content overview
├── talk_outline.md - Detailed presentation structure (both formats)
├── conversation_summary.md - Development audit trail  
└── breadcrumb.md - This master source of truth
```

### **Current Status**
- **Abstract**: Final, conference-ready (format-agnostic)
- **Talk Structures**: Complete for both 20-min (conference) and 40-min (technical meetup) formats
- **Content Distribution**: Core framework in both; Manus production lessons exclusive to 40-min version
- **Research Base**: 11 sources integrated with evidence-based claims
- **Ready For**: Conference submissions (20-min), meetup proposals (40-min), slide development (both)

### **Key Context for Agent Handoff**
- User prefers practical over academic approach
- Research-driven methodology with evidence-based claims
- Style: Personal, engaging, gaming metaphors, "overeager intern" hook
- Quality over quantity: Four strong tactics vs. many weak ones
- **Dual Format Strategy**: 20-min for conferences, 40-min for technical meetups with Manus production lessons
- **Development History**: See [`conversation_summary.md`](./conversation_summary.md) for complete audit trail

### **Research-Backed Claims Ready for Use**
- "30+ tools create confusion" (research threshold - Drew Breunig analysis)
- "44% improvement with smart tool selection" ([Less is More paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15399))
- "54% gains with context offloading" ([Anthropic research](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-think-tool))
- "10x cost difference" cached vs uncached tokens ([Manus production data](https://manus.im/blog/Context-Engineering-for-AI-Agents-Lessons-from-Building-Manus))

### **Core Message**
Context engineering is the systematic discipline that transforms AI coding from frustrating "vibe coding" into reliable, productive human-AI collaboration. The Breadcrumb Protocol demonstrates how structured workflows implement research-proven context management tactics to achieve measurable improvements in AI-assisted development.
