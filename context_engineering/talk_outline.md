- **The Sweet Spot**: When AI works well vs. when it struggles
- **Common Failure Modes**: Poisoning (hallucinations), Distraction (over-focus), Confusion (irrelevant info), Clash (conflicting info)
- **Industry Reality Check**: Technology leaders warning about limitations

#### 2. Context Engineering: The Solution Framework (6 minutes)
- **Definition**: "The art and science of filling the context window with just the right information at the right time"
- **Four Practical Tactics**:
  - **Write Context**: External memory (scratchpad pattern, context offloading)
  - **Select Context**: Smart retrieval (RAG + tool loadout like gaming weapon selection, research shows 30+ tools create confusion)
  - **Compress Context**: Efficient summaries (pruning + summarization)
  - **Isolate Context**: Separation of concerns (context quarantine in dedicated threads)

#### 3. The Breadcrumb Protocol: Context Engineering in Action (5 minutes)
- **The Three Principles**:
  - Structured Planning & Task Management
  - Centralized Knowledge Context  
  - Living Documentation & Shared Understanding
- **Visual Walkthrough**: Screenshots of `.github/.copilot/` structure and breadcrumb workflow
- **Context Engineering in Practice**: How breadcrumbs implement the four tactics - context offloading, smart selection, compression, and quarantine
- **Research Evidence**: Studies show 44% improvement with smart tool selection ([Less is More paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15399)), 54% gains with context offloading ([Anthropic research](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-think-tool))
- **Results**: Contextual continuity, team alignment, reduced friction

#### Conclusion: Why Human Skills Still Matter (1 minute)
- **The Hidden Truth**: Effective AI requires extensive human scaffolding and domain understanding
- **The Future**: AI-assisted development with human expertise, not replacement
- **Call to Action**: Start engineering your context systematically
