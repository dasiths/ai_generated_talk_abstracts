# Vibe Coding is Dead. Long Live Context Engineering.

## Introduction

### Talk Abstract

As AI-assisted development tools like GitHub Copilot become ubiquitous, the industry narrative promises revolutionary productivity gains. Yet many practitioners find themselves frustrated with inconsistent results, context misalignment, and the significant overhead required to make these tools truly effective. This talk explores the gap between AI coding promises and reality, introducing "context engineering" as the critical discipline that determines success or failure in AI-assisted development.

Drawing from industry warnings about "vibe coding" limitations, we'll examine why traditional prompt engineering fails through the constraint-context matrix, and demonstrate why operator skill—the human expertise in scaffolding, steering, and domain understanding—remains essential. The presentation showcases the Breadcrumb Protocol as a concrete example of structured workflows that bridge the context gap, offering attendees practical strategies for effective context engineering and a framework for building sustainable human-AI collaboration patterns that leverage the strengths of both rather than attempting replacement.

I recently wrote about a workflow to use with AI assisted engineering here https://dasith.me/2025/04/02/vibe-coding-breadcrumbs/.

After writing it I came across this post https://blog.thepete.net/blog/2025/05/22/why-your-ai-coding-assistant-keeps-doing-it-wrong-and-how-to-fix-it/ and it made it clear to me as to why my previous approach works well by providing implied context.

This is also explained by the unreliable nature of LLMs as described here too: https://verissimo.substack.com/p/verissimo-monthly-may-2025 and many technology leaders are warning against the vibe coding hype. https://www.geekwire.com/2025/reality-check-microsoft-azure-cto-pushes-back-on-ai-vibe-coding-hype-sees-upper-limit-long-term/

This is where the context engineering comes in to play.

But context engineering itself requires deep domain understanding to be effective, as explained here: https://medium.com/@springrod/context-engineering-needs-domain-understanding-b4387e8e4bf8

This post highlights why operator skills still matters. https://ferd.ca/the-gap-through-which-we-praise-the-machine.html

## Talk Topic Outline (20 minutes total)

### Opening: The Vibe Coding Problem (3 minutes)
- **The Promise vs Reality**: AI coding tools promise magic, deliver frustration
- **The Core Issue**: Context misalignment between developers and AI assistants
- **Why This Matters**: Transition from "vibe coding" to systematic engineering

### 1. Why AI Coding Fails: The Constraint-Context Matrix (5 minutes)
- **Two Key Dimensions**: Open vs. closed solution spaces, implied vs. provided context
- **AI's Limitations**: Senior-level implementation, junior-level design decisions
- **The Sweet Spot**: When AI works well vs. when it struggles
- **Industry Reality Check**: Technology leaders warning about limitations

### 2. Context Engineering: The Solution Framework (6 minutes)
- **Definition**: "The art and science of filling the context window with just the right information at the right time"
- **Four Strategies** (quick overview):
  - Write Context (external memory)
  - Select Context (smart retrieval)
  - Compress Context (efficient summaries)
  - Isolate Context (separation of concerns)
- **From Cheap Demo to Magical Product**: How context quality transforms effectiveness

### 3. The Breadcrumb Protocol: Context Engineering in Action (5 minutes)
- **The Three Principles**:
  - Structured Planning & Task Management
  - Centralized Knowledge Context
  - Living Documentation & Shared Understanding
- **Live Demo**: Quick walkthrough of `.github/.copilot/` structure and breadcrumb workflow
- **Results**: Contextual continuity, team alignment, reduced friction

### Conclusion: Why Human Skills Still Matter (1 minute)
- **The Hidden Truth**: Effective AI requires extensive human scaffolding and domain understanding
- **The Future**: AI-assisted development with human expertise, not replacement
- **Call to Action**: Start engineering your context systematically
